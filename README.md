# UI-Grid-Quickstart
A quick start project to put ui grid in your project without knowing angular or ui grid!

The base code was taken from: http://ui-grid.info/docs/#/tutorial/314_external_pagination.

I cleaned it up a bit, added some functionality, some code comments and made it easier to use. 

To run this application:

1. Install node.JS https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

2. Run this command in terminal (osx / linux) or command prompt (windows): npm install http-server -g

3. In terminal or command prompt go to the directory where you installed the project. For example if you installed it in C:/UI-Grid-Quickstart run the command: 
cd C:\UI-Grid-Quickstart

3. Then run this command: http-server

4. Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8080/

Voila! You know have a working UI Grid that you can point at your rest service endpoint!
